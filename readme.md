# InstaBars

Instabars is a simple and lightweight UIView based control which can be used for symbolising that music or a video is playing. This control is inspired by Instagram iOS Application which shows similar kind of animation when a video is playing.

# Installation
  For now the only way to use Instabars is download/clone the project and copy the directory "InstaBars" in your peoject(I will add this project to cocoapods as soon as I will get time for the same)
  
# How to use
  - Instabars os very simple to use. 
  - Simply add any UIView, and change its class type to "InstaBars"
 
# Customisation
- You can do any type of customisation(such as color, corners, shadows, etc) which you normally do with any other UIView.

# Limitation
- For now, You cannot change the number of bars appearing in this control.
- Even if you will change the size of control the bars will appear at the static position
